          We serve a fantastic range of freshly made to order sandwiches,
          paninis and a great selection of freshly made healthy salads, 
          all topped off with a brilliant range of decadent vegan & gluten free cakes.

          Our rationale is that local has got to be good not just for green reasons, but also because its important to support the little guys. In the process we have discovered some lovely people making lovely food and drink.
          We can’t stock everyone, but wow is there a rich seam out there!

          We have been out, James and me, and tried quite a few local roasteries, and some not so local, and we have chosen what we think are good, smooth and robust coffee beans.
          We have some for sale, so let us know what you think, as we would love to hear your thoughts.

          <!-- With close family having to tolerate gluten intolerance, we have worked hard to keep the menu as gluten-free as possible. Please be aware however that we don’t claim to be a totally gluten-free environment.
          We just think trying to avoid gluten is a healthy option (except in the case of bread, where healthy may have been thrown out of the window). Where possible we have added non-diary, vegetarian and vegan options. -->
